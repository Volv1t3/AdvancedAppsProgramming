# Class #6 | Thursday Jan 30th | Producer-Consumer Threading Paradigm

> The following file contains the last of the content ever presented in the multi-threading java fundamentals 
> section of our course.
> It includes a new and mostly useful model for multithreaded applications, 
> producer-consumer model, its characteristics, synchronization, examples, etc. Additionally, we present information 
> about JavaFX concurrency using the Task class.
> Lastly, we close this chapter by talking about CompletableFuture&lt;E&gt;

<p>In the last leg of the course content for multi-threading applications, we reviewed an important paradigm called 
the producer-consumer relationship, which states that there is always a thread that produces some output, and 
another thread that consumes said output. Examples of this representation can be found throughout computer science, 
for example video and audio streaming services often use this model to handle streaming of cloud content while 
simultaneously requesting and grouping new content such that there is a continuous flow of information towards the 
user.</p>
<p>The model that we studied here, seen mostly through examples in Deitel Deitel Java Programming book, has little 
to do with these complicated applications, but rather has a lot to do with the inner workings and characteristics of 
this process.
</p>

## Producer-Consumer Thread Coordination
<p>Within the <code>concurrent and parallel programming world</code>, certain design patterns have come about to 
simplify architectures, streamline solutions, and optimize codebases that handle these types of application. One 
such design pattern is the <b><code>producer-consumer design patter</code></b></p>
<note><p>A <b><code>producer-consumer design pattern</code></b>, designates a process (thread) as a producer, and 
another one as a consumer. Through these roles, <b><code>the producer is responsible for constantly populating a shared 
memory space or data structure</code></b>, while the consumer <b><code>is in charge of taking/removing 
information from said data structure</code></b>
</p></note>
<p>One of the main issues that can come about from this implementation, given that it can support <b>multiple 
consumers, multiple produces, or both cases at the same time</b>, is the issue of memory corruption (garbling), or, 
in the broadest sense, issues with synchronization.</p>

### Granularity in Producer-Consumer Thread Synchronization
<p>
Within a multi-threaded environment, as we have discussed in previous sections, there is always the inherent thread 
of race conditions, the lost operation problem, thrashing, incorrect or misleading outputs, code that appears to 
work but is actually broken inside, etc. All of these issues are exacerbated in the case of a producer and consumer 
relationship as it is not just one thread that is trying to do a single operation on a shared buffer or data 
structure, but not two, or more threads doing different operations within it.
</p>
<p>For this reason, depending on the multiplicity of these two thread types, we can identify some clear 
complexisites that we must deal with</p>
<procedure collapsible="true" title="Producer-Consumer Issues">
<deflist>
<def title="Single Producer-Consumer Issues">
<list>
<li>If these two attempt to <b>modify or consume shared data at the same time</b>, synchronization issues might 
force some of the information to be lost</li>
<li>Due to the complexity of operations, one or the other might be more expensive and longer than the other, 
forcing one party to wait (eager thread), this leads to a <b>quick consumer that <code>processes elements 
fast and waits longer</code></b>.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if the removing or processing of the produced informatino is slower than its production, we 
have what is known as a <b><code>queue overflow issue</code></b></li>
</list>
</def>
<def title="Multiple Producer-Consumer Issues">
<p>If our application works with more than one of each type of thread, we might have these problems on larger scales,
causing significant issues in performance and synchrony.
</p>
</def>
</deflist>
</procedure>
<p>For these reasons, often there is a need for a buffer, or some data structure that is designed and capable of 
handling multiple producer and consumer threads at the same time. In addition to this, however, it is also important 
to keep a <b><code>lock around data that is shared</code> in order to prevent corruption</b>
. Moreover, one must implement <i><b><code>state-dependent operations</code>, i.e, operations whose inner 
workings depend on the shared state marked by other threads</b></i>. THis idea means that, in the case of shared 
memory and data structures, threads must wait and allow for, a) producers to produce information if there is none to 
read, or b) consumers to consume information if there is no more space to produce information to.
</p>
<p>In general then, we must make our operations granular, and think deeply about the way in which we architect our 
application and use this pattern, it is not just about writing a consumer and a producer that alter some piece of 
memory in our application, it is about enforcing rules, design patterns, and defining code that handles a shared 
buffer of memory effectively.</p>
<p>The next block presents information about granularity, its types and their pros, and cons. The idea is not to go 
too deep into granularity as it is not the concept of this talk, but there will be a listing underneath, detailing 
granularity with a bit more detail</p>

#### Granularity Types â€• Fine-Grained
<deflist type="full" collapsible="true">
<def title="Fine-Grained Granularity Definition">
Fine-grained granularity in producer-consumer threading refers to a <i><code>synchronization approach where 
individual operations or small sections of code are synchronized independently. This pattern uses multiple, specific 
locks to protect distinct parts of the shared resource rather than locking the entire data structure</code></i>. The 
synchronization is <i><code>applied at the lowest 
practical level</code></i>, such as individual buffer elements or specific operations like enqueue/dequeue, 
allowing maximum potential for concurrent execution while maintaining thread safety. This approach <i><code>typically involves separate locks for producers and consumers</code></i>, 
enabling them 
to operate simultaneously on different parts of the shared buffer when possible.

a producer-consumer application example that produces a song lyrics (in practice it would most likely come over the 
internet), and consumes it as a cute print message to the console</p>

#### Granularity Types â€• State-dependent
<deflist type="full" collapsible="true">
<def title="State-Dependent Granularity Definition">
State-dependent granularity in producer-consumer threading <i><code>is a synchronization strategy where the locking mechanism 
adapts based on the current state of the shared resource or system conditions</code></i>. This approach implements 
<i><b><code>synchronization controls that respond to runtime conditions</code></b></i> such as buffer capacity, 
resource availability, or 
processing states. The pattern <i><b>typically uses condition variables or monitors to coordinate thread access based on 
predefined states (e.g., buffer full, buffer empty, or threshold conditions)</b></i>. This dynamic synchronization model 
ensures that threads are blocked or released based on specific state conditions rather than simple mutual exclusion.

#### Granularity Types â€• Coarse-Grained
<p>The last granularity type that is going to be studied (not at depth) in this section is coarse grained 
granularity.</p>
<deflist type="full" collapsible="true">
<def title="Coarse-Grained Granularity Definition">
Coarse-grained granularity in producer-consumer threading represents a synchronization approach <i><b>where larger 
sections of code or entire methods are synchronized as a single unit</b></i>. This pattern 
typically <i><b><code>employs a single lock or synchronization mechanism to protect the entire shared resource or a substantial 
portion of it</code></b></i>. Rather than managing multiple fine-grained locks, it implements broader synchronization 
boundaries 
that encompass complete operations or transactions. The approach <b><code>prioritizes simplicity and safety over maximum 
concurrency</code></b>, using mechanisms like synchronized 
methods or 
blocks that protect entire sequences of operations at once.
</def>
<def title="Advantages and Disadvantages">
<list>
<li>Advantages:
    <list>
        <li>Simpler implementation and easier to understand code structure</li>
        <li>Reduced risk of deadlocks due to fewer lock interactions</li>
        <li>Easier to maintain and debug synchronization logic</li>
        <li>Better guarantee of data consistency across operations</li>
        <li>Lower overhead from lock management and coordination</li>
    </list>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages:
    <list>
        <li>Reduced concurrent throughput due to broader locking scope</li>
        <li>Higher thread contention and longer wait times</li>
        <li>Less efficient utilization of multi-core systems</li>
        <li>Potential performance bottlenecks under high load</li>
        <li>Limited scalability with increasing number of threads</li>

<def title="When to Implement Coarse-Grained Granularity">
<list>
<li>Simple producer-consumer scenarios with moderate concurrency requirements</li>
<li>When operation atomicity is more critical than maximum throughput</li>
<li>Systems where simplicity and maintainability are primary concerns</li>
<li>Applications with low to moderate thread contention</li>
<li>When operations on shared resources are naturally atomic</li>
<li>In prototyping phases where quick implementation is needed</li>
<li>When the overhead of fine-grained synchronization outweighs its benefits</li>

### Characteristics of the Producer-Consumer Thread Model
<p>With the previous code blocks and information, we effectively reviewed a section of Java programming which 
showcased a series of useful classes, and methodologies that, to some extent, go outside the scope of this class and 
this study session (granularity is not a topic in this class, after all we are already looking at databases). 
Nevertheless, the previous code showcases that java allows you to work both incorrectly and correctly, generally 
correctly, as their methods are meant to work unless you seriously kill them by introducing contention or deadlocks. 
</p>
<p>Admittedly, this happened to me in one of the sections above as fine-grained requires multiple locks, and 
implementing those with simple synchronized blocks creates contention problems right away. Rather the idea of lock 
conditions, acquiring reentrant locks, etc., made the code more concise, concurrency-oriented, and cleaner. 
Nevertheless, we saw a series of classes that I would like to review later on when this file is done, i.e., at the 
end of this section we will review Reentrant Locks, conditions, etc.</p>
<p>For now, lets take a look at the main characteristics of the producer-consumer thread model, pros, cons, and use 
cases!</p>

### Examples of Producer-Consumer Thread Models
<p>Having checked some examples of the producer-consumer thread design pattern, it is time for us to take a look at 
three examples that come from the Deitel, Deitel book that we are using to study this section. These are some 
relevant examples as they present information crucial to our understanding of this pattern</p>

#### Single Value Buffer
<p>
This first example, contained and spread around chapter 23.5, presents a code example that works around a single 
value unsynchronized buffer. In this particular example, a producer thread creates a single value at the time, from 
1 to ten, and attempts to place it within the buffer. Once the value is placed the secondary consumer thread 
attempts to read the value and add it to a total. The sum of these values should be <b>55</b>, however, as we know 
due to the use of non-synchronized methods, we should never expect this value to appear.
</p>
<p>The code example in this chapter showcases how a program can be written completely incorrectly even though it is 
using this design pattern. The reason that this code example is important is that it <b><code>showcases 
what can go wrong when we apply multithreading design patterns without considering memory management, 
synchronization and locks.</code></b></p>

```Java

// Deitel Deitel Java 23.5
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;


class Consumer implements Runnable {
   private static final SecureRandom generator = new SecureRandom();
   private final Buffer sharedLocation; // reference to shared object

   // constructor
   public Consumer(Buffer sharedLocation) {
      this.sharedLocation = sharedLocation;
   }

   // read sharedLocation's value 10 times and sum the values
   @Override
   public void run() {                                       
      int sum = 0;

      for (int count = 1; count <= 10; count++) {
         // sleep 0 to 3 seconds, read value from buffer and add to sum
         try {
            Thread.sleep(generator.nextInt(3000));
            sum += sharedLocation.blockingGet();          
            System.out.printf("\t\t\t\2d\n", sum);
         } 
         catch (InterruptedException exception) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); 
         } 
      } 

      System.out.printf("\n\s \d\n\s\n", 
         "Consumer read values totaling", sum, "Terminating Consumer");
   } 
} 

interface Buffer {
   // place int value into Buffer
   public void blockingPut(int value) throws InterruptedException; 

   // return int value from Buffer
   public int blockingGet() throws InterruptedException; 
} 

public class SharedBufferTest {
   public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
      // create new thread pool 
      ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

      // create UnsynchronizedBuffer to store ints       
      Buffer sharedLocation = new UnsynchronizedBuffer();

      System.out.println(
         "Action\t\tValue\tSum of Produced\tSum of Consumed");
      System.out.printf(
         "------\t\t-----\t---------------\t---------------\n\n");

      // execute the Producer and Consumer, giving each 
      // access to the sharedLocation
      executorService.execute(new Producer(sharedLocation));
      executorService.execute(new Consumer(sharedLocation));

      executorService.shutdown(); // terminate app when tasks complete
      executorService.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES); 
   } 
} 

class UnsynchronizedBuffer implements Buffer {
   private int buffer = -1; // shared by producer and consumer threads

   // place value into buffer
   @Override
   public void blockingPut(int value) throws InterruptedException {
      System.out.printf("Producer writes\t%2d", value);
      buffer = value;
   } 

   // return value from buffer
   @Override
   public int blockingGet() throws InterruptedException {
      System.out.printf("Consumer reads\t\2d", buffer);
      return buffer;
   }
} 

class Producer implements Runnable {
   private static final SecureRandom generator = new SecureRandom();
   private final Buffer sharedLocation; // reference to shared object

   // constructor
   public Producer(Buffer sharedLocation) {
      this.sharedLocation = sharedLocation;
   } 

   // store values from 1 to 10 in sharedLocation
   @Override
   public void run() {                           
      int sum = 0;

      for (int count = 1; count <= 10; count++) {
         try { // sleep 0 to 3 seconds, then place value in Buffer
            Thread.sleep(generator.nextInt(3000)); // random sleep   
            sharedLocation.blockingPut(count); // set value in buffer
            sum += count; // increment sum of values
            System.out.printf("\t\2d\n", sum);
         } 
         catch (InterruptedException exception) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); 
         } 
      } 

      System.out.printf(
         "Producer done producing%nTerminating Producer\n");
   } 
} 
```

<p>The previous code produces an output similar to that of this.</p>

```Text

Action		Value	Sum of Produced	Sum of Consumed
------		-----	---------------	---------------

Producer writes	 1	 1
Producer writes	 2	 3
Consumer reads	 2			 2
Consumer reads	 2			 4
Consumer reads	 2			 6
Producer writes	 3	 6

Terminating Producer

```

<p>This is what happens when we are working with a series of unsynchronized methods. Generally, since there are no 
synchronization rules, there are issues with reading and writing to a shared buffered state, notice how some methods 
read the values correctly, but on some other cases the consumer appears to read a value that is not there at all, 
while the producer is updating the values correctly, the issue lies with the interleaving of these two in our system 
and the synchronization issues with the writing onto the shared sum of values buffer.
</p>
<p>From the methods displayed above, nothing comes to mind that is different or new, the only remarkable thing is 
that we are using <b>executors</b> to handle thread start, joining, and concurrent considerations.</p>

#### ArrayBlockingQueue Buffer
<p>The next example we reviewed in class is the ArrayBlockingQueue buffer implementation. The ArrayBlockingQueue is 
part of a series of classes I had wanted to cover later on this section but I will do not, that come in the 
concurrent package within java base. These are specialized data structures that implement the concept of blocking 
queues, or some blocking mechanism to provide a layer of synchronization to Threads.</p>
<note><p>All blocking data structures pick up from the interface <i><b><code>BlockingQueue&lt;
E&gt;</code></b></i>, that is designed to handle both operation from Collection, but also operations that 
tolerate <b>waiting until there is a space in the queue to place or remove data</b>. These effectively then 
support blocking (locks for memory) for operations like put or take</p>
<p>There are five versions of this <b><code> LinkedBlockingQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue, SynchronousQueue, 
PriorityBlockingQueue, and DelayQueue</code></b></p></note>

<p>The idea of this implementation, then, is to showcase how a class can implement the synchronization methods that 
we require for a producer-consumer implementation for us, showing that Java has various functionalities that are 
already built in to make programming in multithreading applications easier. The following is the ordered code 
segments from the book, formatted to be run in a single java file</p>

<p>As can be noted, the usage of this internal class from Java has not only reduced the complexity of the code that 
we have to write, but it also guarantees that our output follows a logical execution and is factually correct even 
if we execute threads independently or through an executor service. Again, the only different between the two 
versions is the usage of a blocking queue, and an executor service to handle the threads internally.</p>
<p>The last version of this code in this section will showcase how to to work with more advanced methods, and locks.</p>

#### ArrayBlockingQueue Buffer By Hand
<p>This example was the second to last example we saw in class. We saw here how to use a complex 
implementation of a buffer where we had a buffer size and we handled how threads iterated over our buffer through 
methods defined or locks. These methods are part of the Object class (<code>wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()</code>)
. THe use of these methods guarantees that the code will pause and resume execution depending on the state within 
our code, this being an example of a coarse-grained implementation of the producer-consume granularity principle.
</p>
<p>The idea in this example is that we will not only use the methods defined for thread control and synchronization, 
but we will also use guards (conditions and base parameters of a coarse-grained implementation), all in an effort to 
control the access of these producer and consumer threads to our shared buffer. Before we go deep into the code, we 
should note two things
</p>
<note><p>To move away from an <i><b>non-synchronized execution methodology</b></i>, we should first identify 
variables (state) that might be shared, and attempt to use either synchronized methods or blocks to handle these 
data points
</p></note>
<note><p>In Java, within all sections of code we can call methods like <i><b><code>wait(), 
notify(), and notifyAll() </code> to <code>force a thread to pause its execution until 
notified, notify any waiting thread to resume execution, and notify all waiting threads to 
resume execution</code></b></i>. In general these methods are meant to be used to move a thread from the 
Runnable (Running state) to the waiting state.</p></note>

<p>Again, as with our discussion on coarse-grained granularity, we can see that this class implements a series of 
methods from the Buffer interface in such a way that they use both <b><code>synchronized methods, and 
contorl flags (i.e., occupied variable)</code></b> to control method access, state access, and memory locks for each 
thread. Since they use a cached thread pool, the most logical idea is that the method uses one thread for the 
consumer and another one for the producer. However, this then means that the program needs to handle their state to 
work properly. To do this, the program implements the control flag occupied and uses it to determine whether to 
notify threads to wake up, or send the current thread to sleep.</p>
<p>The methods used for these two are <code>notifyAll(), and wait() respectively</code>, given that the first 
notifies all threads to wake up, and wait tells the current thread to sleep</p>
<warning><p>Although we can think of this as two threads running at any given time, the use of the while 
loop for condition checking guarantees that if more than one thread is created at any given moment, the 
condition is checked for all threads.</p></warning>

#### Bounded Buffer
<p>The last example that was presented in the book was a new, and improved, version of the ArrayBlockingQueue buffer 
with a circular buffer that had three positions, being capable of handling both a Read and Writer Index and their 
positions independently. The idea of this example was that internally, these two consumer and producer threads would 
have to communicate with the shared memory and determine where the read and write indexes are based on internally 
defined values that are updated with each read and write operation. Let us take a look at the code at hand so we can 
see it closely

<p>Effectively then, we can see that we can create our own buffers and manage synchronization on our own with simple 
structures so long as we use the correct keyword and control operations thoroughly.

### Locks, Reentrant Locks, and Conditions
<p>Before we move onto Multithreading in JavaFX (A topic that was covered briefly in class), we should take a look 
at the methodology that Java offers to handle fine-grained synchronization. These classes, <b><code>Lock, 
ReentrantLock, Condition
</code></b>, among others, allow the programmer to control specifically how a program executes, and how the producer 
consumer relationship should work with respect to halting conditions (<code>waiting transitions</code>), and 
runnning state transitions.
</p>
<p>To this end, we will discuss each of these classes briefly and list some of their useful methods with a small 
description, for a more thorough view of them, refer back to the Java Specification API Overview webpage.</p>

<deflist collapsible="true" type="full">
<def title="Java.util.concurrent.locks">
<p>This is the base package where most interface and classes dedicated to thread synchronization lie. These classes 
are meant to be used as a framework for locking and waiting for conditions in a way that is distinct from the 
built-in synchronization methods or blocks, or monitor locks. </p>
</def>
<def title="Lock Interface"><p>TheLock interface is meant to <i>"support locking disciplines that differ 
in semantics (reentrant, air, etc), and that can be used in non-block-structured contexts including 
hand-over-hand and lock reordering algorithms"</i></p>
<p>The main implementation of this interface is <b><code>ReentrantLock</code></b>. Locks are generally 
preffered when the implementation has to do with precise control over threads, and require not just the simple 
single-thread-modification rule that monitor locks bring about.
</p>
<p>Internally, the main implementation comes in the form of ReentrantLocks, a class that has the basic 
functioning of a monitor lock, but with various additional methods that allow you to resolve contention easily (by a 
parameter on its constructor), and methods to investigate ownership on the fly.
</p></def>
<def title="Conditions">
<p>Condition is a class meant to replace, and abstract away, the methodology used by monitor locks, i.e. 
<code>wait, notify, and notifyAll</code>, with methods like <code>await(), and signal/signalAll()</code>. </p>
<note>Whenever we replace a synchronized block or method with Locks, we should also replace monitor locks with 
Conditions</note>
</def>
</deflist>
<p>Lastly,let us take a look at an example for this fine-grained thread implementation for a Flight control 
system where the produces simulates inbound planes attempting to land, the consumer a controller ordering the planes 
to land, and the runway a concurrent array where each plane has to be inputted in an order from less remaining fuel 
to more remaining fuel.

## Multithreading in JavaFX
<p>In JavaFX, the last stop in our journey on having Threads and concurrent programming, there is a singular class 
that allows us to execute this model of programming, <code>Tasks</code>. Task is a class that allows you to run 
operations in parallel with the main application Thread, it effectively serves the same purpose as a normal Thread 
in a console applicaiton, with the difference between Runnable Threads and Tasks being that Task can send signals 
and information back up to the screen through Bound Properties, binding them to the original window or main thread 
through observable values.</p>
<p>In JavaFX, our applications often reside in a single core thread, called the JavaFX <code>Application 
Thread</code>, from which we modify the GUI based on user's interactions and internal state of the application. 
However, when our application handles some specific requirement that is hard and long to compute on a single thread, 
we risk having our application become unresponsive, something that would likely end up angering the user, and is 
effectively negatively viewed by most users.
</p>
<p>The solution to this is to.</p>
<note><p>Always isolate long-running operations to Threads outside the JavaFX Application Thread. Remember 
that a JavaFX Application can have backend tasks done in other threads if needed, using structures just like 
we have used for console applications</p></note>
<p>However, it is more appropriate in JavaFX to use a class that is implemented to handle these long running tasks 
while also connecting itself to the JavaFX main application thread through property binding, i.e., it is 
<i>generally better to handle lon-running tasks using Tasks rather than Threads in JavaFX</i></p>

### Tasks
<p>JavaFX provides a series of classes that are used to handle concurrent modifications to our application while 
keeping the main Application Thread running and responsive, from these the most common, and the ones that are 
studied in the book are <i><b><code>Worker, Task and ScheduledService (not covered in our course)</code></b></i>. 
From these two, Task is an implementation of Worker (which is an interface), that allows you to both run a task in 
another Thread, but also return a value (like an async operation), and handle updates to the GUI through its 
properties</p>
<p>Tasks are generally implemented with a specific generic type, as these are more akin to CompletableFutures rather 
than Threads, in their ability to return a value once their execution has finished. While this class is huge, and 
provides not only methods to handle concurrent programming and result handling, it also provides methods for 
interconnection with another thread (JAVAFX Application Thread), and can be graciously used to produce and update 
constantly values to the UI, or to produce content to the UI.

#### Tasks â€• Fibonacci Calculator
<p>This is one of the examples of the book, reproduced here for completeness and for analysis purposes. The idea is 
to evaluate how this method works by presenting side by side the JavaFX controller and the Task code</p>

```Java
// Fig. 23.24: FibonacciTask.java
// Task subclass for calculating Fibonacci numbers in the background
import javafx.concurrent.Task;

public class FibonacciTask extends Task<Long> {
   private final int n; // Fibonacci number to calculate

   // constructor
   public FibonacciTask(int n) {
      this.n = n;
   } 

   // long-running code to be run in a worker thread
   @Override
   protected Long call() {
      updateMessage("Calculating...");
      long result = fibonacci(n);
      updateMessage("Done calculating."); 
      return result;

   // recursive method fibonacci; calculates nth Fibonacci number
   public long fibonacci(long number) {
      if (number == 0 || number == 1) {
         return number;
      }
      else {
         return fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2);

<p>From the code example above, we can see four important sections which can be broken down into two groups, worker 
-> main thread, and main thread -> worker communication. The first group is easy to see in the first codeblock as it 
is shown in statements like <b><code>updateMessage()</code></b>, these are the methods that come from the 
<i><b><code>observable value parameters within the Task class</code></b></i>, meaning that this method is 
effectively talking to the main application thread from the worker thread. On the other hand, in the second 
codeblock we can see the second communication path, through <b>property binding</b> which takes care of connecting 
those observable values from the Task to the properties of the main JavaFX application thread.
</p>
<p>All in all, the interconnection method is not complicated, it is simply a second layer of complexity that is 
added ontop of the normal JavaFX property binding methodology. To finish up this section, I shall call on our friend 
Amazon Q to provide us with a listing of key concepts, pros, cons, and use cases.

## Completable Futures
<p>The last topic we are going to cover here are completable futures. Before, we studied the concept of Completables,
which we did with the class Callable (returned a future that we can call). Now the superset of this class is 
CompletableFutures which is a parametrized class that allow us to execute code asynchronously, be it a 
<b><code>supplier that returns a value or a Runnable that only executes code</code></b>. The benefit of this class 
is that it presents methods not just for handling results, exceptions, or interruptions, but also to concatenate 
multiple Runnable or Suppliers, as well as defining more complex methodologies like performing a second task after a 
completable future, or two Runnables in tandem. The following is a listing provided by Amazon Q for pros, cons, use 
cases, and characteristics of Completable Futures.

        int years = 450;

        // Use a custom thread pool for demonstration
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Run two separate computations for both amounts
        CompletableFuture<BigDecimal> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
            () -> calculateCompoundInterest(initialAmount1, annualInterestRate, years), executor

            if (year % 50 == 0 || year == years) { // Print progress for every 50 years or the final year
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +
